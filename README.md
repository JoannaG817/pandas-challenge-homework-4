# PyCity Schools Analysis
•	Schools with higher budgets did not yield better test results. Schools with higher spending 645-675 per student actually underperformed compared to schools with smaller budgets (585 per student).  
•	Smaller and medium sized schools dramatically out-performed large sized schools on passing math performances.  
•	Charter schools out-performed the public district schools across all metrics.   
•	Average math and reading scores stay consistent across grade level when grouped by school.   
•	Math passing rates are always consistently lower across every metric, but the difference between math and reading passing rates is greater among lower performing schools, large schools, and higher spending per student which all seem to correlate.  
•	The top five schools are all charter schools while the bottom five all district schools.  
•	In general, per student spending is higher in bottom performing schools than top performing.  
•	Schools under 2000 students have much higher passing rates than those with student populations above 2000.
